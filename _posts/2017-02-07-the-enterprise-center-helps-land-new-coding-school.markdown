Through a partnership between The Enterprise Center and Birmingham-based company Covalence, a new 10-week coding school program will launch starting in spring of 2017.  The program offers an accelerated coding curriculum in an effort to provide valuable IT training to more Chattanoogans as well as meet the local demand for skilled employees in the technology sector.  Using a highly-effective, boot-camp style, Covalence teaches aspiring developers how to code by offering accelerated, demand-driven full stack and front end coding programs.  

Covalence will occupy the first floor of the former Municipal Water building located at 1001 Lindsay St. in the heart of Chattanoogaâ€™s Innovation District.
