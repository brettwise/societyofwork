A case study released by Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society Business on Chattanooga's gig and smart grid shows that the savings produced by the smart grid, plus revenue from access fees paid by the utility’s Internet access business, more than cover the capital and operating costs of the smart grid. What’s more, the report estimates this would still be true even if the utility hadn’t received a $111.6 million federal stimulus grant, and instead borrowed the extra amount.
