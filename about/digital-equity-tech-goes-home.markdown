Like all cities, Chattanooga faces a major digital divide characterized by a disparity in technical literacy, hardware adoption, and Internet access among its citizens based on income, race, and age.  The Enterprise Center has been tasked with developing programs to meet this challenge head on by building programs to ensure that the city's digital assets are available to everyone in Chattanooga.

**Tech Goes Home Chattanooga**

**Growing Our Workforce with a New Coding School**

Through a partnership between The Enterprise Center and Birmingham-based company Covalence, a new 10-week coding school program will be established starting in spring of 2017.  The program offers an accelerated coding curriculum in an effort to provide valuable IT training to more Chattanoogans as well as meet the local demand for skilled employees in the technology sector.  Using a highly-effective, boot-camp style, Covalence teaches aspiring developers how to code by offering accelerated, demand-driven full stack and front end coding programs.  

Covalence will occupy the first floor of the former Municipal Water building located at 1001 Lindsay St. in the heart of Chattanooga’s Innovation District.
