### What is the Innovation District of Chattanooga?

In 2013, newly elected Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke tasked a group of 25 Chattanoogans with determining how to build on the success already realized through ad-hoc, volunteer-based, loosely-organized efforts to maximize the "gig" opportunity.

A few months later, Mayor Berke, Hamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger, and Congressman Chuck Fleischmann responded to the task force's recommendations by forming a new entity focused solely on guiding community efforts related to the "gig": The Enterprise Center.

### The Edney Innovation Center
