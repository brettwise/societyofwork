  title: Area History
  body: |-
    In the heart of downtown, Chattanooga's Innovation District is approximately a quarter mile walking radius. This vibrant and walkable area contains Chattanooga’s main downtown public spaces and a host of coffee shops and eateries, linked by attractive streets, a bike share program and free downtown electric shuttle.

    Chattanooga is the first mid-sized city with an established Innovation District. In addition to designing spaces specifically for workers and companies in the new knowledge economy, Chattanooga's innovation district provides easy access to other assets enjoyed by those working in the districts including coffee shops, pubs, restaurants, and multimodal transportation.

    an American Institute of Architects award for its design excellence in the public
    realm. It was both a symbol of the city’s commitment to the quality of the public
    realm and a sign of more improvements to come. Miller Plaza and the adjacent Miller
    Park and Patten Parkway together form the primary downtown public spaces. Each
    has its own character and host a variety of uses from casual and serendipitous,
    to those marked by large gatherings and entertainment. In 2015 the City of Chattanooga
    launched a public design process to upgrade features of all three parks.
