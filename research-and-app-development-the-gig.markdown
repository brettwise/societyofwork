### Research & Application Development

The Enterprise Center (TEC) maximizes Chattanooga's potential to attract a wide range of researchers to use the city’s smart grid and gigabit assets as a test bed and living laboratory for the development of next generation products, processes and services.

**PUTTING OUR GIG TO WORK**

This work builds on the success of several initiatives, in particular two applications that successfully leverage GENI, which provides advanced connectivity between 55+ research institutions and the Chattanooga community.  

​One of these connects a 4K camera and microscope at the University of Southern California to the Chattanooga STEM school, providing students with a unique resource for classroom applications. Another is the live streaming of the Alligator Bayou habitat at the Tennessee Aquarium to the Chattanooga Airport, made possible thanks to Nokia. More applications of these technologies are being readied.

To encourage use of Chattanooga as a test bed for research, The Enterprise Center, EPB and UTC and partners (ORNL, U.S. Ignite, University of Southern California and others) helps facilitate the submission of grant applications to National Science Foundation (NSF). Recently NSF announced two new grants for UTC researchers in the areas of autonomous fleet vehicles and mapping and analysis of underground infrastructure. Three grants have been received from Mozilla to support and expand projects using 4K video streaming, 4K microscopes and virtual reality. 

US Ignite has funded The Enterprise Center with $90,000 over a three-year period to support the development of new applications for high speed bandwidth, and has provided an additional $25,000 to partially fund a microscope and camera to establish Chattanooga as a hub for advanced classroom learning experiences. Another NSF funded project using the city as a test bed is in the process of deploying sensors to monitor and communicate health related components of air quality.

Few if any cities are in a position to have the kind of research and computational assets of our smart grid and gigabit network so close to and in partnership with a National Lab. In the last year this partnership has made great strides, with ORNL readying a staffed office in Chattanooga to advance the city as a test bed, particularly in the areas of energy, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing. TEC, as a public-private partnership designed to assist such partnerships is helping move the agenda forward.

In summer 2016, Chattanooga was featured nationally at an 1800-person U.S Ignite Summit Smart Community Week event in Austin TX. In addition to demonstrating the 4K education pilot between the Chattanooga STEM School and USC, two other demonstrations grabbed national attention. One was live streaming of 4K video from the Tennessee Aquarium to a large screen at the conference facilitated by the work of Nokia and ng Connect. The other was use of LOLA technology to enable musicians at the Chattanooga Public Library and in Austin TX 1,000 miles apart to play music in real time together over the Internet. At this conference Chattanooga received one of only 15 Smart Cities Communities Award, given this year for the first time by US Ignite.
