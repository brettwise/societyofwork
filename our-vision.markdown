### WHAT IS THE ENTERPRISE CENTER?

In 2013, newly elected Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke tasked a group of 25 Chattanoogans with determining how to build on the success already realized through ad-hoc, volunteer-based, loosely-organized efforts to maximize the "gig" opportunity.

A few months later, Mayor Berke, Hamilton County Mayor Jim Coppinger, and Congressman Chuck Fleischmann responded to the task force's recommendations by forming a new entity focused solely on guiding community efforts related to the "gig": The Enterprise Center.

**We Believe:**
* Information technology and innovation are driving the new global economy.
* In working together collaboratively.
* Equity and inclusion must be hallmarks of our work.
* Chattanoogaâ€™s unique character and spirit are key advantages for a leap into the new economy.
