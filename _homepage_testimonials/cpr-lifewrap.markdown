testimonial_text: "“The Innovation District is a place where unknown start-ups and
  established companies can come and attain information, mentorship and network to
  better their brand. When you are there it isn’t a competition to scale but it’s
  a family environment constructed to help each other. When one company succeeds we
  ALL succeed. It’s not all about making millions of dollars but the true satisfaction
  for me is being that guiding light for other companies that will come after me and
  watching them excel, scale, and succeed.”"
