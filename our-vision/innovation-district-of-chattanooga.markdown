### What is the Innovation District of Chattanooga?

In the heart of downtown, Chattanooga's innovation district is approximately a quarter mile walk radius from the intersection of M.L. King Blvd and Georgia Avenue. This vibrant and walkable area contains Chattanooga’s main downtown public spaces and a host of coffee shops and eateries, linked by attractive streets, a bike share program and free downtown electric shuttle.

Chattanooga’s Innovation District is a designated section of the city where creative thinkers, entrepreneurs, students, and tech-savvy innovators can collide and collaborate to conceive and implement new ideas.
